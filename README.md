# Even-or-Odd-Number-Sorter
This JavaScript function reads a number from an input field, checks if the number is even or odd, and then appends the number to a designated &lt;div> element. Even numbers are appended to a &lt;div> with the ID np and odd numbers to a &lt;div> with the ID ni. Each number is wrapped in a paragraph element followed by a line break.
